## Parse reaction expressions

MiKiAC has built in a powerful reaction expression parser based on Python's regular expression engines. With the help of reaction parser, you can check the site and mass conservation to make sure MiKiAC can receive correct reaction expressions and solve correctly.

### Species name convetions in MiKiAC

All species expressions in MiKiAC consist of two parts connected with a underline `_`: species name and site name.

For example, a `CO` gas molecule adsorbed on a site named `s` can be written as `CO_s`. 

For the transition state species in MiKiAC, it must have a `-` character indicating a bond like `O-O_2s`.

Below are some common species expression examples:

- `O2_2s`: A O2 (oxygen molecule) adsorbed on two `s`sites
- `CO_b`: A CO (carbon dioxide molecule) adsorbed on one `b` site
- `O-O_2t` A transition state for O2 dissociation on two `s` sites

### Reaction expression conventions in MiKiAC

Each elementary reaction expression consists of different states: initial state, transition state(optional), final state.

For example, a CO adsorption on a single `s` process can be expressed as:

```python
CO_g + *_s -> CO_s
```

As we can see, we can use arrows `<->` or `->` to connect all states to an elementary reaction expression.

If a process is a chemical reaction, usually it has a transition state in the middle. For example, a O2 dissociation adsorption process can be written as:

```python
O2_g + 2*_s <-> O-O_2s -> O_s + O_s

# or 

O2_g + 2*_s <-> O-O_2s -> 2O_s
```

### Parse an elementary reaction

`mikiac.parser.rxn_parser` provide three main classes to represent different levels in a reaction expression: `RxnEquation` for reaction equation expression, `ChemState`for chemical state and `ChemFormula` for chemical formula.

In this section, we use mikiac reaction parser API to parse elementary reaction expression using a O2 dissociation adsorption process as an example.

#### Create reaction equation

```python
from mikiac.parsers.rxn_parser import RxnEquation

rxn_expression = 'O2_g + 2*_s <-> O-O_2s -> 2O_s'

# Create a reaction equation object
rxn = RxnEquation(rxn_expression)
```

#### Revert equation

```python
reverse_rxn = rxn.revert()
reverse_rxn.rxn_equation()  # Output: '2O_s <-> O-O_2s -> O2_g + 2*_s'
```

#### Check conservation

``` python
rxn.check_conservation()  # return True
```

If we construct an unconserved reaction equation, an exception will be raised.

### Balance a set of elementary reactions

Reaction parser in MiKiAC can help researchers to balance a set of elementary reactions to obtain the total reaction equation.

Here we take CO Oxidation as an example, the elementary reactions are listed below:

```python
[
    'CO_g + *_s -> CO_s',
    'O2_g + 2*_s <-> O-O_2s -> 2O_s',
    'CO_s + O_s <-> CO-O_2s -> CO2_g + 2*_s'
]
```

After model has been built, we can get the total reaction expression:

```python
model.parser.get_total_rxn_equation()
```

the output would be:

```python
'2CO_g + O2_g -> 2CO2_g'
```
